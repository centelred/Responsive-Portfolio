                            After years in the automotive industry, I decided it was time for a change.  I thought long and hard, and made up my mind to become a web developer.  In the days of Myspace, I would spend hours coming up with the perfect layout.  Twice a month for a year, I edited my css, created graphical layouts.  Little did I know at the time, that I was setting myself up to become a part of one of the fastest growing industries at the moment.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My ultimate goal is to become the best I possibly can.  I am focused and organized, and ready to become a pivitol asset to any team.  Help me help you, and give me a call.  I'll be waiting!
